::=============================================

@echo off

::Let's set a couple of Global Variables. Here, Globals will start with
::A lowercase 'g' and Global Paths will start with lowercase 'gp'

::here we set the gpAlpha to the current directory that the script is ran from
set gpAlhpa=%cd%

::here we'll set a path to reach the lua bin directory, which should be a subdirectory of our main folder
::then we'll set a var to the path to the actual lua interpreter .exe, so that we can pass it as an executable
set gpLuaBin=%gpAlhpa%\lua\bin
set lua=%gpLuaBin%\lua.exe

::next, we'll call our executable variable, with the name of the script we're trying to run
%lua% FullTest.lua

::finally, we'll pause the batch, so that it doesn't automatically close when the script is done
